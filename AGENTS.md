# AGENTS.md — kalidots

Context for AI agents working in this repository.

## What this project is

A modular, resumable Kali Linux bootstrap system. It installs packages, creates a primary user, deploys a desktop environment and dotfiles, imports secrets, and configures LLM tooling. Everything runs as root and is orchestrated by a stage runner with JSON state tracking.

## Repository layout

```
bootstrap/
  bin/kali-bootstrap        Entry point. Sources libs, parses CLI, runs stages.
  lib/                      Shared shell libraries (see "Libraries" below).
  stages/                   Auto-discovered stage scripts (NN-name.sh).
  files/                    Static config files, package manifests, policy files.
tests/bootstrap/lib/        Unit tests for library functions.
```

## Architecture concepts

### Profiles and stages

There are seven **profiles**: `base`, `desktop`, `keyboard`, `tools`, `secrets`, `llm`, `theme`. Each **stage** declares which profiles it belongs to via a `stage_profiles` array. The runner discovers all `bootstrap/stages/*.sh` files alphabetically, matches them against selected profiles, and executes them in order. The `keyboard` profile is separate from `desktop` — it covers system-level/low-level keyboard configuration (e.g. Kanata), not desktop-environment-specific keybindings. The `theme` profile is independent from `desktop` — it overlays color schemes on top of already-deployed desktop configs.

Stage `21-bootstrap-user-cleanup` has no profile — it only runs when explicitly requested via `--stage bootstrap-user-cleanup`.

### Stage contract

Every stage file **must** declare these top-level variables and functions:

```bash
stage_id="my-stage"                          # Unique identifier
stage_description="What this stage does"     # Human-readable
stage_profiles=("profile1" "profile2")       # Which profiles trigger this stage

stage_apply() {
  # Mutating work: install packages, deploy files, create users, etc.
}

stage_verify() {
  # Non-mutating checks: command -v, file existence, permissions, group membership.
  # Return 0 on success, 1 on failure.
}
```

Stages are sourced into the runner's shell. They can use any function from the libraries loaded by the runner (`log.sh`, `state.sh`) and should source additional libraries they need from `${BOOTSTRAP_ROOT}/lib/`.

### State machine

Each stage transitions through: `pending` → `applying` → `verifying` → `verified` (or `verify_failed`). State is persisted to `.bootstrap/state.json`. On re-run, `verified` stages are skipped. Stages stuck in `verifying` or `verify_failed` get their `stage_verify` re-checked before re-applying.

### Package policy

Each profile has a policy env file (`bootstrap/files/packages/*-policy.env`) that controls:
- `PACKAGE_POLICY_PLATFORM` — must be `kali`
- `PACKAGE_POLICY_ALLOW_EXTERNAL` — `0` (apt only) or `1` (external sources permitted)
- `PACKAGE_POLICY_EXTERNAL_EXCEPTIONS` — CSV of allowed external tools (e.g., `starship,kanata,rustup-toolchain`)

Stages that install from external sources (curl, GitHub releases, `go install`) must only do so when the loaded policy permits it.

## Key globals

These are set by `cli.sh` and used throughout:

- `BOOTSTRAP_ROOT` — absolute path to `bootstrap/` directory
- `SELECTED_PROFILES` — array of active profile names
- `SELECTED_STAGE_IDS` — array of explicitly requested stage IDs (overrides profile matching)
- `TARGET_USER` — the primary user being configured (prompted or from env/state)
- `BOOTSTRAP_USER` — the user running the installer
- `STATE_FILE` — path to `.bootstrap/state.json`
- `ASSUME_YES` — skip confirmation prompts when `true`

## Conventions to follow

### Shell style

- All scripts use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and `set -euo pipefail` (stages inherit this from the runner).
- Use `log_info`, `log_warn`, `log_error` for output — never raw `echo` for user-facing messages.
- Whitespace trimming uses the POSIX parameter expansion pattern: `${var#"${var%%[![:space:]]*}"}` (see `trim_whitespace` in `users.sh`).
- File deployment uses `install -D -m MODE -o OWNER -g GROUP SRC DEST` for atomic ownership + permissions.
- Config file paths under the user's home use `install_user_file` from `desktop.sh`.

### Keyboard vs Desktop profile boundary

The `keyboard` profile covers system-level/low-level keyboard configuration (Kanata, key remapping, input device setup). Desktop-environment-specific keybindings (i3 bindsym, Hyprland binds) belong in `desktop`. When adding new keyboard-related stages, use the `keyboard` profile and the 35-39 numbering range.

### Theme profile

The `theme` profile uses the 200-series numbering range. Each theme is a separate stage (e.g., `200-theme-pink-blood.sh`, `201-theme-next.sh`). Theme stages overlay color configs on top of desktop-deployed files — they use `sed` for i3 config color variables and `install_user_file` for full replacements of smaller configs. Theme config files live under `bootstrap/files/theme/<theme-name>/`. The theme profile requires the `desktop` profile to have been run first (configs must already exist to overlay).

### Adding a new stage

1. Create `bootstrap/stages/NN-name.sh` where `NN` determines execution order.
2. Declare `stage_id`, `stage_description`, `stage_profiles`.
3. Implement `stage_apply` and `stage_verify`.
4. Source any needed libraries from `${BOOTSTRAP_ROOT}/lib/`.
5. If the stage needs the target user, call `load_or_prompt_target_user >/dev/null` at the start of `stage_apply`.
6. If the stage installs apt packages, put them in `bootstrap/files/packages/PROFILE-apt.txt` and use `ensure_apt_packages`.
7. If the stage needs external downloads, ensure the profile's policy file has `PACKAGE_POLICY_ALLOW_EXTERNAL=1` and the tool is listed in `PACKAGE_POLICY_EXTERNAL_EXCEPTIONS`.

### Adding a new package

Append the package name to the appropriate `bootstrap/files/packages/*-apt.txt` manifest. One package per line, `#` comments allowed. The `ensure_apt_packages` function handles idempotent installation.

### Verification patterns

`stage_verify` should only read state, never mutate. Common patterns:
- `command -v BINARY >/dev/null 2>&1` — check binary availability
- `[[ -f PATH ]]` — check file exists
- `stat -c %a PATH` / `stat -c %U PATH` — check permissions/ownership
- `id -nG USER | grep -qw GROUP` — check group membership
- `getent passwd USER | cut -d: -f7` — check login shell
- `systemctl is-enabled SERVICE` — check systemd unit

### Config file deployment

Static config files live under `bootstrap/files/`. The path structure mirrors the destination:
- `files/desktop/i3/config` → `~/.config/i3/config`
- `files/desktop/i3/scripts/*.sh` → `~/.config/i3/scripts/*.sh` (mode 755)
- `files/desktop/alacritty/alacritty.toml` → `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
- `files/theme/pink-blood/*` → themed overlays deployed by `200-theme-pink-blood.sh`

Some configs use placeholder substitution (e.g., `__TARGET_HOME__` replaced with the actual home path at deploy time via `sed`). When adding new configs, check whether the stage does substitution.

### Bashrc drop-ins

Shell initialization uses a drop-in directory pattern. Stages append a sourcing block to `~/.bashrc` (idempotently checked with `grep`) and place individual scripts in `~/.bashrc.d/NN-name.sh`. The number prefix controls load order.

## Tests

Tests live in `tests/bootstrap/lib/` and are plain bash scripts. Run them directly:

```bash
bash tests/bootstrap/lib/users_prompt_fallback_test.sh
bash tests/bootstrap/lib/secrets_import_test.sh
```

Test conventions:
- Each test file sources the library it tests and defines `assert_eq`, `assert_contains`, `assert_nonzero` helpers.
- Tests mock functions by redefining them (e.g., override `gum`, `prompt_with_fallback`, `state_get_value`).
- Temp directories are cleaned up via `trap ... EXIT`.
- Tests print `PASS` / `FAIL` and exit 0/1.

## Things to be careful about

- **Runs as root**: Every stage runs with root privileges. File ownership must be explicitly set to `TARGET_USER` when deploying to the user's home.
- **State file is the source of truth for resumability**: Don't manually edit `.bootstrap/state.json` unless debugging. The runner uses it to skip verified stages.
- **LLM manifest contract**: The `llm_assert_manifest_contract` function enforces that all three LLM tools (codex, claude, gemini) remain `manual` method with `not-installed-by-bootstrap`. Do not change this.
- **No secrets in state**: API keys, passwords, and credentials must never be written to `state.json` or committed. The LLM and secrets stages deploy templates and documentation only.
- **Telemetry registry**: Every tool in `tools-apt.txt` and `desktop-apt.txt` must have a corresponding entry in `privacy/telemetry-registry.env`. Stage `42-tools-privacy` enforces this.
- **System groups**: The `uinput` group must have GID < 1000 (system group) for udev rules to work. Use `groupadd --system`.
